Homework Repo for Challenge 14

# Introduction
GitHub Page: https://tlclaurab.github.io/belly-button-challenge/

Using data collected by the Public Science Lab, I created a dashboard based on their [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/). For the purposes of this assignment, I used a [static set of data](https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json) provided by Bootcamp.

In total, three graphs were created -- a Bar Chart and a Bubble Chart to display the type of microbial species found in the sampling and that sample's density, and a Gauge Chart to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual.  There was also a Metadata display on the individual profiled, and a dropdown menu to change individual profiles.

# Overview
I received help and support from my fellow Data Viz classmates during class time, through Slack, and via our Discord server. I regularly attended both the before and after-class office hours.

I encountered an error early on that kept triggering the debugging feature, pausing my JSON file at a certain line. But it presented curiously: the code would stop on Line 11, but displayed no error message in the Console.

I engaged an AskBSC-Learning Assistant session via Slack, working with Dinh Chau. He said that it was "probably fine" as it was not adversely affecting the code itself, which we confirmed was working.
